                <p><b>The warehouse is an integral part of the trading business. This is the most important component of the business process for any retail company, regardless of whether it uses its own warehouse, rents it or resorts to the services of specialized operators. It is quite obvious that without effective warehouse accounting, trading activities are doomed to failure.</b></p>
                <p>The traditional approach to warehouse accounting, when all management is in the hands of the storekeeper, is the most uncomplicated of all possible. In this case, automation is not provided at all, or it is present in a minimal form. Despite the stupidity of this approach, this method, due to its simplicity and low cost, remains the most common to this day.</p>
                <p>More advanced methods of organizing warehouse activities assume the presence of an accounting system in the warehouse that records information about the product and its location. The availability of information about what and where lies allows warehouse workers to optimize the route of collection and placement of goods. However, how optimally the goods will be placed in the warehouse depends entirely on the operator.</p>
                <p>When using WMS (Warehouse Management System), the emphasis is on automation of management. With the help of complex algorithms that take into account data about the warehouse and the goods placed on it, WMS systems optimize the process of organizing warehouse activities as much as possible, in fact taking over all warehouse management.</p>
                <h2>Pros and cons of WMS</h2>
                <p>Sooner or later there comes a time when traditional methods of warehouse accounting cease to meet the increased needs of business. Due to the increasing turnover of goods, warehouse processes lose manageability, and the organization of affairs in the warehouse increasingly resembles chaos. In this case, a large-scale reorganization cannot be avoided, and the question arises about the automation of warehouse activities. According to the developers of WMS, among the advantages that the company that has implemented this system receives are the most efficient use of storage facilities, ensuring an optimal level of inventory, uninterrupted shipment of goods, etc.</p>
                <p>In practice, however, things may be different. Most automated systems of the ERP class, which includes WMS, as a rule, consist of three components. The first of them is the interface through which users interact with the system. The second is a data warehouse that provides access to information. The third is business logic, that is, special procedures through which data processing algorithms are implemented in response to a user request.</p>
                <p>The introduction of ERP systems belonging to the class of &quot;heavy&quot; and practically not offered in the form of boxed solutions is associated with high costs and can last for a long time. Most companies come to the need to have a WMS when the volume of warehouse activity is large and significant changes are required for reorganization. Management should understand that it is possible to increase the efficiency of the warehouse by implementing WMS only over time. The problems associated with the transition to a new method of work are also inevitable.</p>
                <p>Firstly, the staff will have to learn a lot and get used to working in a new way. WMS will require drastic changes in all work processes, which will be a stressful situation for most. You need to be prepared for the fact that not everyone will agree to accept such radical changes and some employees will have to part ways. Some of the staff may openly or covertly sabotage the changes, which also will not speed up the transition process. Staff training always requires a lot of effort, time and money, and if you try to save money on it, it will probably do more harm than good.</p>
                <p>Secondly, the external environment is also unlikely to be ready for significant changes. Any large trading company has a large number of suppliers, each of which is used to working in its own way, and WMS imposes strict requirements for the acceptance of goods. For example, a large number of unmarked goods in the flow of goods will cause problems in the operation of the warehouse and greatly slow down its functioning. Therefore, it is necessary to build relationships with suppliers in advance, developing uniform rules for the shipment of goods.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, it is necessary to take into account the scale of the company&apos;s growth and the need for further expansion. The main disadvantage of WMS is the low warehouse fill factor, usually not exceeding 0.5. This factor should be kept in mind when designing a warehouse and building long-term forecasts for the development of the enterprise.</p>
                <p>Finally, it is necessary to keep in mind the difficulties of the transition period. No company can afford to stop the operation of the warehouse for the period of implementation of the automated system. We must be prepared for the fact that for some time the work of the warehouse will be irregular, there will be inconsistencies and errors. In addition, the WMS must collect initial information about the goods and their storage locations. Only as the data accumulates will it be possible to use optimization algorithms to improve the efficiency and speed of the warehouse. At this stage, well-established communications within the company are extremely important: only a good mutual agreement will allow you to resolve misunderstandings as quickly and clearly as possible.</p>
                <p>In general, the success of the implementation of any &quot;intelligent&quot; system depends, first of all, on how fully and thoroughly the business logic is implemented in it. That is why the process of preparing technical specifications for a WMS system is complicated. At the preliminary stage, it is necessary to carry out a lot of analytical work, prescribe all the actions performed in the warehouse, create ready-made solutions and algorithms. If all automated processes are well structured and formalized during the preparation of the terms of reference, then the system will really allow you to manage the warehouse.</p>

                <h3>Leaders of WMS systems</h3>
                <p>Today, there are many different WMS systems on the market, which differ from each other, first of all, by the scale of the processed data. To organize the efficient operation of the warehouse, it is necessary to choose a WMS that meets all the requirements of the organization of business processes in the warehouse: working with barcodes, reading expiration dates, GTD numbers, etc. Simultaneously with the introduction of WMS, it will be necessary to purchase additional equipment (special warehouse equipment, racks, terminals), mount a network and install servers. It is important to take into account not only the difference in prices from different suppliers, but also the technical characteristics of the selected equipment, its capabilities and operability, as well as the availability of service centers.</p>

                <p>IT professionals specializing in warehouse activities assure that a simple investment in automation will not be able to seriously increase the productivity of the warehouse. A banal replacement of some resources with others, albeit more technologically advanced, is not enough. The competent organization of the exploitation of these resources becomes a non-trivial task: anyway, in any system there is a person on whom a lot depends. Attempts to negate the influence of the human factor by means of automation, of course, are doomed to failure. Introducing even the most modern and technologically advanced management tools, we must not forget that the key to the success of any activity is an organized team of qualified specialists who responsibly approach their work and believe in a common goal.</p>
