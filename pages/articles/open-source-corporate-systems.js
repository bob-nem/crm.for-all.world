                <h2>What is Open Source ERP?</h2>
                <p>Open Source ERP is a software system available under one of the open source licenses, such as the GPL or MIT. It allows you to host your own copy of this software, modify it and use it at your discretion in accordance with the terms of this license.</p>
                <p>Almost all solutions on the market offer two versions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>managed SaaS (software as a service), for which you pay monthly according to the services and the number of users in your organization;</li>
                    <li>an offline Open Source version that you can download for free without support.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>How to choose an Open Source ERP?</h2>
                <p>Which system to use depends on:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Your own scenario and use cases.</li>
                    <li>The size of your organization and the number of employees.</li>
                    <li>The type of modules and functions you need.</li>
                    <li>Your possible budget.</li>
                    <li>Other criteria you may have (user interface, type of software (web or desktop), localization support, plugin support, etc.).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Apparently, the first step should be to try out the ERP system that you like on your local machines, check whether it is sufficient for your tasks and employees, and if so, you can either purchase it as a SaaS, or request professional support when necessary, or choose the free version.</p>
                <p>But why would you prefer one software to another? There are many reasons for this: the proposed functionality of this ERP system, the design of the user interface, the programming language of the system, your IT department capable of modifying and developing this system, localization, compatibility with GDPR ... and many other similar criteria.</p>

                </div>
                <p>This ERP system is more classical. The user interface is not quite modern, but still provides a lot of features that may be useful to you. Dolibarr is written in PHP. Its development began back in 2002.</p>
                <p>Like others, <Link href="https://www.dolibarr.org/onlinedemo"><a title="Dolibarr developer" target="_blank">Dolibarr</a></Link> provides modules for managing CRM, sales, finance, human resources, electronic documents, projects, calendars... and many similar tasks.

                <p>Using the motto &quot;modularity, scalability and security&quot;, <Link href="https://www.tryton.org/"><a title="Tryton developer" target="_blank">Tryton</a></Link> is a unique ERP system compared to other options. Its architecture uses a three-tier model to maximize the modularity of the software, making it closer to a structure that can be developed later for any additional requirements.</p>
                <label>The Triton system consists of 3 parts:</label>
                <ol>
                    <li>Triton database: A data storage system such as PostgreSQL.</li>
                    <li>Triton Server: The main application responsible for providing Tryton functions.</li>
                    <li>Triton Client: Desktop/web-based server communication software.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Triton mainly uses a desktop client for its operations, thanks to which it initially works in various Linux distributions (you can even find it in official repositories). The whole system is written using Python and uses the GTK library for its desktop client. If you need, there is also a web client.</p>
                <p>Triton provides modules for CRM management, accounting, sales, inventory… But it also provides modules for supply chains, manufacturing and shipping, which makes it suitable for factories or stores.</p>
                <p>Triton also <Link href="https://www.tryton.org/download"><a title="Tryton demonstration providing" target="_blank">provides</a></Link> a free demo, docker images, ready-made binaries for Windows, Linux and macOS. It is also available as a Python package that can be installed using pip. Many <Link href="https://pypi.org/search/?c=Framework+%3A%3A+Tryton"><a title="Tryton side modules realization" target="_blank">third-party</a></Link> modules can also be installed for the system using pip.</p>

                <p><Link href="https://www.erp5.com/"><a title="ERP5 developer" target="_blank">ERP5</a></Link> positions itself as &quot;the most powerful open source ERP system&quot;. It includes a huge set of modules, which makes it suitable for almost any type of business. These modules include banking, Accounting, CRM, HRM, Projects, e-commerce, PDM, KM, forums, consulting, barcode, email marketing, billing and production management modules.</p>
                <p>The development of ERP5 began back in 2002, so it has been on the market for almost two decades. It is written in Python. ERP5 is really very popular all over the world, you can find it in ordinary retail stores or official banks of the country using ERP5 somewhere in their ecosystem.</p>
                <p>However, the disadvantage is that the user interface of the system is very old and classic. It&#39;s not modern like the other ERP solutions mentioned here.</p>

                    />
                </div>
                <p><Link href="https://flectrahq.com/"><a title="Flectra developer" target="_blank">Flectra</a></Link> is another ERP system released just a few years ago. Flectra is actually a fork of <Link href="https://optimization.for-all.world/#Odoo"><a title="Flectra is a Odoo fork" target="_self">Odoo</a></Link>, however, Flectra was created apparently for two main reasons: first, to provide more open source collaborative development, as well as to offer much <Link href="https://medium.com/@parthivpatel_26549/double-prices-or-double-standards-3826cf56178d"><a title="Flectra prices" target="_blank">better prices</a></Link> for SaaS subscriptions provided by <Link href="https://optimization.for-all.world/#Odoo"><a title="Odoo comarizon" target="_blank">Odoo</a></Link>, and secondly, to provide more features that the community needs.</p>
                <p>Odo did not like this move and considered Lectra as one of its possible competitors who used their open source based on their open source, so they started a <Link href="https://www.odoo.com/page/flectra-vs-odoo-flectrahq-enterprise"><a title="Flectra vs Odoo lawsuit" target="_blank">lawsuit</a></Link>. The trial lasted almost a year, as a result of which the jury in India <Link href="https://medium.com/@parthivpatel_26549/the-great-copyright-suit-of-odoo-vs-flectra-and-the-conclusion-698c9f6facc7"><a title="Indian jury declaration" target="_blank">declared</a></Link> that Flectra does not infringe copyrights and can continue working.</p>
                <p>Thus, Electra provides the same modules as Ado, but with a much better price and a noticeably newer user interface. There are also many <Link href="https://flectrahq.com/odoo-community-vs-odoo-enterprise-vs-flectra-comparison"><a title="Flectra new feachures" target="_blank">new features</a></Link> supported by Lectra, but not supported by Odoo.</p>

                <p>Like any other ERP solution from our list, Axelor can manage your CRM, marketing, sales, human resources, BPM, supply chain and all your finances. The system also supports some specific industries, such as retail stores, manufacturing, associations and public sector organizations.</p>
                <p>Axelor offers a very modern user interface, and also provides ready-made files for Windows and Linux distributions, as well as a Docker image.

                <p>Axelor is also compatible with the new GDPR rules in the European Union.</p>
                <p>There is a full <Link href="https://fosspost.org/axelor/"><a title="Axelor review" target="_blank">review of Axelor</a></Link> with a description of possible use cases and functions.

                <h2>General questions about Open Source ERP</h2>
                <h3>Are one of world most popular ERP - SAP and Oracle is Open Source ERP systems?</h3>
                <p>No. Both SAP and Oracle ERP systems are proprietary ERP systems, which means you are not allowed to access their source code or create your own instance as you like. They are also not free.</p>
                <h3>Which Open Source ERP is the best?</h3>
                <p>There is no &quot;best&quot; open source ERP. Some ERP systems are better than others in some aspects and vice versa. Choosing the &quot;best&quot; one depends entirely on your needs and scenarios of its use, as well as on how many services/employees you are going to have in your organization.</p>
                <p>To find the best open source ERP for yourself, we recommend deploying a test server and trying out all the available ERPs that we have provided you with in our main list.</p>
                <h3>Are all Open Source ERP systems free?</h3>
                <p>Not obligatory. The availability of open source code does not oblige the developers of these ERP systems to give them away for free, and they can still request payment from you. However, in most cases, an open source ERP system can be free.</p>
                <h3>Closed-source ERP Systems vs. Open Source ERP Systems</h3>
                <p>The advantages of using a proprietary ERP system are discouraging. Unless you need to depend heavily on the support of software developers, there is no real benefit in paying too much for a subscription to a proprietary ERP system.</p>
                <p>Most of the features that are in proprietary solutions have many alternatives, if not better, in open source solutions. Many organizations and companies that are among the top 500 companies in the USA have started using open source alternatives for their infrastructure.</p>
                <p>If your organization is not too big (+2000 employees) and you will always need fast or non-standard developments from ERP vendors, using open source ERP systems is really better.</p>
                <h3>Is it worth trying Open Source ERP?</h3>
                <p>Definitely! After all, they are — for the most part - free, so it doesn&#39;t cost you anything to try them out. In addition, switching to them may become a possible cost-saving strategy for your company or organization.</p>
                <p>Moreover, if you ever need some modules or add-ons for your chosen open source ERP according to your needs, you will find that hiring freelancers/third-party developers to develop them is much better than depending on a proprietary solution service.</p>
                <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
                <p>You have seen in this list a lot of good open source ERP systems that you can use in your organization. Which one to choose depends on what features or scenarios your business will need. It may also depend on the number of users you may have in your company, because a huge number may mean you&#39;ll be paying thousands for software subscriptions per year, or you may want to set up your own instances of these open source ERP systems.</p>
