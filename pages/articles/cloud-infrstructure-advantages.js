                <h2>ERP IN THE CLOUD — WHAT IS IT AND WHY?</h2>
                <p>In this article, we will first look at cloud technologies in general, then in application to ERP systems. And in conclusion, let&apos;s find out the features of cloud technologies from the largest suppliers of ERP systems.</p>
                <h2>What is a &quot;cloud&quot;? And what is the benefit?</h2>
                <p><Link href="https://www.gartner.com/en"><a title="about gartner" target="_blank">Gartner</a></Link> defines cloud computing as a style of computing in which scalable and elastic IT capabilities are provided as a service to external customers using Internet technologies. In other words, cloud technologies offer IT rental instead of purchase. Companies do not invest in IT equipment, software and databases, but get access to these resources via the Internet and pay for their use.</p>
                <p>The main idea of using cloud technologies is that access to a common pool of computing resources is economically more profitable than the maintenance of each consumer of their computing resources.</p>
                <p>The benefit is achieved due to the fact that systems with multi-core processors are used at the cloud solution provider level, which reduces the volume, power consumption and cost of equipment, while maintaining the same computing power. And high-capacity storage systems enable economies of scale.</p>
                <p>At the consumer level, savings are achieved due to the fact that exactly as many resources are consumed as necessary in a given period (computing power is not purchased &quot;for the future&quot;).</p>
                <h2>The National Institute of Standards and Technology of the USA has fixed the following mandatory requirements for cloud solutions:</h2>
                <p>Self-service on demand - the consumer, without interaction with a cloud service provider, independently determines their computing needs: the amount of stored data, server time, access speed and data processing;
                    Universal network access — services are available to consumers via a data transmission network, regardless of the terminal device used;
                    Pooling of resources — a service provider combines resources for servicing a large number of consumers into a single pool for dynamic redistribution of capacity between consumers in conditions of constant changes in demand for capacity;
                    Elasticity - services can be provided, expanded, reduced at any time, without additional costs for interaction with the supplier, as a rule, in automatic mode;
                    Consumption accounting — the service provider automatically calculates the resources consumed (for example, by the amount of data stored, bandwidth, number of users, number of transactions) and based on these data estimates the volume of services provided to consumers.
                </p>
                <p><b>Models of &quot;clouds&quot;.</b> From the point of view of equipment ownership and access provision, &quot;clouds&quot; are divided into three types: public, private and hybrid.</p>
                <p><b>A public &quot;cloud&quot;</b> is an infrastructure designed for free use by a wide range of customers. The public &quot;cloud&quot; belongs to and physically exists in the jurisdiction of the owner/service provider.</p>
                <p>The largest cloud service providers in the world are: Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Alibaba Cloud, IBM, Dell Technologies/VMware, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Cisco Systems, Oracle.</p>
                <p><b>A private &quot;cloud&quot;</b> is an infrastructure designed for use by a single organization that includes several consumers (for example, divisions of one organization), possibly also by customers and contractors of this organization. A private cloud can be owned, managed and operated by both the organization itself and a third party (or some combination thereof), and it can physically exist both inside and outside the jurisdiction of the owner. For example, cloud servers can be located on the territory and managed by a provider of public cloud services, but be allocated only to a specific organization.</p>
                <p>Private clouds can be a solution in cases where a company would like to take full advantage of cloud technologies, but for some reason, cannot use public clouds. Often such a reason is the Law &quot;On Personal Data&quot; and security requirements. In addition, the company must be large enough for the cloud solution to be cost-effective or make sense from the point of view of streamlining the company&apos;s IT structure.</p>
                <p>A hybrid cloud is a combination of two or more different cloud infrastructures (private, public or public) that remain unique objects, but are interconnected by standardized or private data transfer technologies and applications (for example, short-term use of public cloud resources for load balancing between clouds). Hybrid clouds can also include systems deployed on enterprise resources.</p>
                <p>Most studies show that at least half of the companies using cloud solutions use hybrid clouds, and their share is growing.</p>
                <h3>Services in the cloud</h3>
                <p>The services provided by cloud owners can be divided into several categories: infrastructure, platform and software.</p>
                <h3>Software as a &quot;cloud&quot;</h3>
                <p>Software as a service (SaaS, English Software-as-a-Service) is a model in which the consumer is given the opportunity to use the application software of a provider operating in a cloud infrastructure and accessible to the client either through a thin client, usually from an Internet browser, or through a special interface.</p>
                <p>From the point of view of ERP systems, it looks like this. The service provider provides the client with access to the ERP system. The client can configure the system according to their requirements and use it. Updates, backups, and other administration functions are performed by the vendor. The supplier also solves technical problems that arise in the system during operation. That is, the physical equipment, the system software, the ERP system itself and the issues of network access are the responsibility of the supplier.</p>
                <p>Many modern ERP systems are delivered to the consumer exclusively as a service. For example, Oracle Fusion, Oracle NetSuite. Others can be both in the service version and in the classic version. For example, SAP S/4HANA.</p>
                <h3>Technology platform as a &quot;cloud&quot;</h3>
                <p>Platform as a service (PaaS, English Platform-as-a-Service) is a model when the client is given the opportunity to use the supplier&apos;s technological infrastructure with basic software for the subsequent placement of new or existing client applications on it. This model is focused on development using the tools provided, such as: tools for working with databases, &quot;big data&quot;, artificial intelligence, application development including software components, security settings. Some vendors offer application integration services and other tools and services.</p>
                <p>Within the ERP space, platform-as-&quot;a-service (PaaS) technology is the implementation of an idea proposed by companies salesforce.com and NetSuite.</p>
                <h3>Infrastructure as a &quot;cloud&quot;</h3>
                <p>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS, English Infrastructure-as-a-Service) is a model when the client is given the opportunity to use the provider&apos;s cloud infrastructure.</p>
                <p>That is, the client is provided with virtual equipment (processors, memory, disk space, network) on which he can install and configure his virtual machines. At the same time, the supplier provides flexibility in changing hardware parameters (increasing the number of processors, disk space, etc.).</p>
                <p>From the point of view of ERP systems, IaaS is interesting because an ERP system can be installed on the basis of such an infrastructure, which was not originally developed as a cloud system. For example, 1C or Oracle JD Edwards.</p>
                <p>Cloud in which IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS are simultaneously available to the user is called a Multi-cloud.</p>
                <ul><label><h3>The main ERP systems can be divided into three groups in relation to cloud technologies:</h3></label>
                    <li>Fully cloud-based, for example, Oracle Fusion, NetSuite;</li>
                    <li>Partially cloud-based, for example, SAP HANA;</li>
                    <li>Capable of working in the cloud using a platform, for example, JDE, 1C;</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Fully cloud-based ERP</h3>
                <p>Fully cloud-based ERP systems are distributed exclusively by subscription and cannot be installed on enterprise equipment. Examples of such systems are: Oracle Fusion, Oracle NetSuite, Dynamics 365, SalesForce and others.</p>
                <ul><label><h3>Advantages of fully cloud-based systems:</h3></label>
                    <li>Built-in update mechanisms designed to work in the cloud</li>
                    <li>Availability of automated system administration tools</li>
                    <li>As a rule, a single development toolkit available through an Internet browser</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Minuses:</b>It is not possible to transfer the system to the equipment of the enterprise. Lack of control over the equipment on which the system is installed</p>
                <h3>Partially cloud-based ERP</h3>
                <p>Some systems, in particular SAP S/4HANA, have versions capable of running on enterprise servers &quot;on-premise&quot; and in the cloud. Cloud versions can be deployed in public clouds (Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services), private or hybrid. For example, development and testing environments are in a public cloud, and a productive environment is in a private one.</p>
                <ul><label><h3>Advantages of such systems:</h3></label>
                    <li>The ability to transfer a system from a public cloud to a private one and vice versa</li>
                    <li>Comparative ease of transition between cloud and server versions of the system</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Minuses:</b>There are specific features of deployment on each type of cloud and clouds of different service providers. Systems capable of running in the cloud</p>
                <p>The third type of systems in relation to cloud technologies are systems capable of working in the cloud thanks to the platform. For example, 1C or Oracle JD Edwards. In this case, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service) is used. The system is simply deployed on a virtual server in the cloud.</p>
                <p><b>Advantages of this approach:</b>A relatively simple transition from a cloud solution to an &quot;on-premise&quot; and vice versa</p>
                <p><b>Minuses:</b>The costs of maintenance and administration of such systems from the outside are higher than those of systems originally developed as cloud.</p>
